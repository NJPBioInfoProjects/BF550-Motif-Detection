# BF550-Motif-Detection
 
# Motif Finding Project

## Overview
This repository contains the **Motif Finding Project** for the BF550 Bioinformatics course. The project focuses on implementing sequence analysis techniques to identify motifs in DNA sequences. It demonstrates fundamental bioinformatics concepts, including mutations, pattern recognition, and sequence alignment, using built-in Python libraries.

## Features
- Implementation of motif finding algorithms
- Analysis of mutations in DNA sequences
- Built-in Python libraries (no external dependencies)
- Structured functions following project guidelines

## Project Structure
- `Project_1_Motif_Finding_petrunich.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation, explanations, and code.
- `project_1_Nicolas_Petrunich.py` – Expected submission format for final code packaging (as per project guidelines).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NJPBioInfoProjects/BF550-Motif-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd BF550-Motif-Detection
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Project_1_Motif_Finding_petrunich.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive execution)

## Notes
- The project follows a structured format where functions should be implemented in sequence.
- Only built-in Python libraries are used.

## License
This project is for educational purposes under the BF550 course guidelines.
